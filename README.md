# Simple Calculator

A simple calculator project that demonstrates basic mathematical operations and shell scripting.

## Description

This project contains a shell script that performs simple interest calculations. The script takes user input for principal amount, rate of interest, and time period, then calculates and displays the simple interest.

## Features

- Simple interest calculation
- User-friendly input prompts
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Clear output formatting

## Usage

To use the simple interest calculator:

1. Make sure the script is executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x simple-interest.sh

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./simple-interest.sh
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to enter:
   - Principal amount
   - Rate of interest (in percentage)
   - Time period (in years)

## Example

```
Enter the principal amount: 1000
Enter the rate of interest (in percentage): 5
Enter the time period (in years): 2

Simple Interest: $100.00
Total Amount: $1100.00
```

## Requirements
